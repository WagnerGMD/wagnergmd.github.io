##	About the licence :
First of all, at the begining, GitHub didn't show in the list (from the template) one license like [Creative Commons_v4.0 (International)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).
Perhaps I will changed replace it (in the futur). So, for now, it will be **GNU GPL_v3**.
